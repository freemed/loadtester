Load Tester
===========

This load tester is designed to work with HDIV-protected websites, and is
multithreaded.

Use "-h" for a list of options.

"mvn package" will produce an executable jar file in the target/ directory.

To get limited output for testing, try something like:

  java -jar target/loadtester-VERSION.jar -t testcase/test.xml -c 2 2>&1 | grep LoadTest
